# Movie-Database
This was a final project for my OOP course in my Junior year

 I created a Java desktop application that utilizes the API provided by themoviedb.org. The application searches themoviedb.org using the keywords provided by the user for any movies containing said keywords. The user can then add any of the movies in the search results to their own movie database within the desktop application.
